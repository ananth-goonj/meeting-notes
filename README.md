# Goonj Claude skills

Shared Claude skills for Goonj teams, distributed as a plugin.

Currently one skill: **meeting-report** — turns a meeting transcript into a bilingual
English/Hindi Excel report with key points, action items (owner, due date, priority),
decisions taken versus deferred, open questions and risks.

## Transcripts

Transcripts - live conversations from any AI Tools. Granola would be preferred.

Ensure Granola plugin is enabledin Chrome as mentioned below - (in the address line)

## What the computer needs

Claude runs this plugin's scripts on the computer where it is running — nothing is sent to a
server by the scripts, and nothing comes bundled. So that computer needs, once: **Python 3**
(3.9 or newer), the **openpyxl** library, and on Windows or Linux **LibreOffice**. Copy the
commands for your system.



### Mac

Open **Terminal** and run these two lines. If Python is missing, the first one offers to install
Apple's Command Line Tools — accept and wait, then run it again.

```bash
python3 --version
```

```bash
python3 -m pip install openpyxl
```

LibreOffice is **optional on a Mac**: transcripts convert with the built-in `textutil`, and Excel
computes the Summary counts when the file is opened. Install it only if you want the counts
verified before the report is delivered — [libreoffice.org](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/),
or `brew install --cask libreoffice` if you use Homebrew.

### Windows

Open **Terminal** (right-click the Start button → *Terminal*) and run these three lines. `winget`
is built into Windows 10 and 11. **LibreOffice is needed here** — Windows has no built-in
converter for `.rtf` / `.docx` transcripts.

```powershell
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e
```

```powershell
winget install --id TheDocumentFoundation.LibreOffice -e
```

**Close and reopen Terminal** so it picks up the new installs, then:

```powershell
py -m pip install openpyxl
```

On Windows the Python command is **`py`** (or `python`), not `python3` — the skill knows this,
so you need not tell it.

### Check it worked

Paste this and look for the word `ready` — Mac:

```bash
python3 -c "import openpyxl; print('ready')"
```

Windows:

```powershell
py -c "import openpyxl; print('ready')"
```

If something is missing when a report is requested, the skill stops and says exactly what to
install rather than guessing.

## Install (one time)

You need a paid Claude plan — Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise. Plugins are not available on
the free tier.

### In the Claude desktop app

1. Open the **Claude desktop app**. If you are in Cowork, open the **Cowork** tab first.
2. In the left sidebar, open **Customize**, then the **Plugins** tab.
3. Choose **Add from a repository** and paste `https://github.com/ananth-goonj/meeting-notes`.
4. Install the **goonj-meetings-skill** plugin.

### In the terminal (Claude Code CLI)

If you do not have Claude Code yet, install it — Mac:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Check with `claude --version`, then run `claude` once and follow the login prompt in your
browser. After that, register this repository and install the plugin — two commands, from any
folder:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ananth-goonj/meeting-notes
```

```bash
claude plugin install goonj-meetings-skill@goonj-skills
```

The plugin loads the next time you start `claude`. (Inside a running session the same two
commands work with a leading slash: `/plugin marketplace add ananth-goonj/meeting-notes` and
`/plugin install goonj-meetings-skill@goonj-skills`; the session then reloads it for you.)

## Set up the glossary (one time, per transcripts folder)

The skill reads an organisation glossary so it can correct mangled names and know your
workstreams. **The glossary is not in this repository** — it names real people, so it
lives with the transcripts instead.

1. Copy `plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/skills/meeting-report/reference/glossary-template.md`
2. Save it in your transcripts folder as **`meeting-report-glossary.md`**
3. Fill in the real names, term variants, workstreams and thresholds

Anyone on the team can edit it. Add a name the transcripts keep getting wrong and the next
report picks it up. If a Goonj glossary already exists in your shared transcripts folder,
you do not need to create one.

## Use it

**Desktop app:** connect your transcripts folder, then ask in plain language:

> Make a meeting report from the 3 September Leadership transcript

**Terminal:** start Claude Code *in the transcripts folder*, so it can see the transcript and the
glossary:

```bash
cd "/path/to/Meeting Transcripts/Leadership"
```

```bash
claude
```

Then ask in the same plain language, or call the skill by name:

```text
/goonj-meetings-skill:meeting-report the 3 September transcript, English only
```

For a one-shot run that exits when done, put the request on the command line:

```bash
claude "Make a meeting report from the 3 September Leadership transcript, English only"
```

It asks one question first — **English only, or English + Hindi?** English only is the default
and is noticeably faster; choose it when the report is for office or leadership readers, and
choose Hindi when it is going to field teams. Say so in your request ("English only") and it
will not ask. The Hindi columns exist in the file either way, just hidden when unused, so the
same workbook can have Hindi added later without rebuilding.

The workbook is written next to the transcript as
`Meeting_Report_<Workstream>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.xlsx`.

## उपयोग कैसे करें (संक्षेप में)

1. कंप्यूटर पर **Python 3** और **openpyxl** होना चाहिए (Windows पर `.rtf`/`.docx` के लिए
   **LibreOffice** भी)। कैसे लगाएँ, ऊपर *What the computer needs* में देखें।
2. Claude डेस्कटॉप ऐप में **Customize → Plugins → Add from a repository** से यह प्लगइन जोड़ें,
   या टर्मिनल में `claude plugin marketplace add ananth-goonj/meeting-notes` और फिर
   `claude plugin install goonj-meetings-skill@goonj-skills` चलाएँ।
3. अपने ट्रांसक्रिप्ट फ़ोल्डर में `meeting-report-glossary.md` फ़ाइल रखें (टेम्पलेट ऊपर बताए पथ पर है)।
4. फिर बस इतना कहें: "3 सितंबर की Leadership मीटिंग की रिपोर्ट बना दीजिए"।

पहले एक सवाल पूछा जाएगा — रिपोर्ट **केवल अंग्रेज़ी** में चाहिए या **अंग्रेज़ी + हिन्दी** दोनों में?
फ़ील्ड टीमों के लिए हिन्दी चुनें। हिन्दी न चुनने पर अनुवाद होगा ही नहीं, और रिपोर्ट तेज़ी से बनेगी।

रिपोर्ट एक Excel फ़ाइल के रूप में उसी फ़ोल्डर में बन जाएगी जिसमें ट्रांसक्रिप्ट है। हर पंक्ति अंग्रेज़ी
और हिन्दी दोनों में होती है, और हर पंक्ति के साथ ट्रांसक्रिप्ट से प्रमाण दिया जाता है।

**ध्यान दें:** जिन पंक्तियों में Confidence कॉलम `Medium` या `Low` है, उन्हें आगे भेजने से पहले
एक बार जाँच लें। ट्रांसक्रिप्ट कभी-कभी नाम ग़लत सुनते हैं और वक्ताओं को आपस में मिला देते हैं।

## What the workbook contains

| Sheet | Contents |
|---|---|
| Summary | Meeting details, live counts, and 8–12 key points |
| Action Items | Every commitment, with owner, due date, priority and a confidence rating |
| Decisions | What was settled, and separately what was deferred and who it waits on |
| Open Questions | Unresolved questions, each with a named person who owes an answer |
| Risks and Compliance | Control gaps and exposure, written in business terms |
| How to Use | Bilingual legend for every column and status value |

Status, Priority and Confidence are dropdowns. Changing a Status updates the Summary
counts automatically, so the workbook works as a live tracker after the meeting.

## Two things to know before circulating a report

1. **Check every row marked `Medium` or `Low` confidence.** Auto-transcripts mishear names
   and merge several speakers into one block. The skill flags what it is unsure of rather
   than guessing, but a person has to make the final call.
2. **`None` in the Due basis column means no timing was agreed on the call.** That is a
   finding, not a formatting gap. Those are the actions that slip.

## For maintainers — how the skill is structured

The skill ships three scripts, and the agent is told not to write spreadsheet code itself:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/to_text.py` | Converts the transcript (`.rtf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.vtt`) to plain UTF-8 text. Uses LibreOffice where installed, falls back to the built-in `textutil` on macOS, and strips `.vtt` cue timestamps itself. |
| `scripts/build_report.py` | Takes a JSON of extracted content, writes the formatted workbook, recalculates it. Owns every colour, header, formula, dropdown and the whole How to Use sheet. `--language english` hides the Hindi columns; it never removes them, because the Summary formulas address columns by letter. |
| `scripts/verify_report.py` | One pass over the finished workbook: every Evidence quote checked against the transcript and no row without one, formula errors scanned, Summary counts recounted, the content rules enforced (deferred decisions name who they wait on, questions name who answers, dropdown columns hold only their allowed words), low-confidence rows listed. |

This keeps report formatting identical across every meeting and every person, and stops the
agent re-deriving the same layout on each run. Change a colour or add a column **in the script**,
not in `SKILL.md`. Evidence is always the last column of a sheet, so adding one never moves a
letter the Summary formulas depend on.

`reference/example-content.json` and `reference/example-transcript.txt` are a fictional worked
example. They build and verify clean, so after any script change run:

```bash
python3 plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/skills/meeting-report/scripts/build_report.py plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/skills/meeting-report/reference/example-content.json --out /tmp/example.xlsx --no-recalc && python3 plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/skills/meeting-report/scripts/verify_report.py /tmp/example.xlsx plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/skills/meeting-report/reference/example-transcript.txt
```

Prerequisites are listed under *What the computer needs* above. `build_report.py` finds
LibreOffice on Linux, macOS and Windows; if it is not installed the workbook is still correct —
Excel recalculates on open — but `verify_report.py` cannot check the counts. Set
`SOFFICE=/path/to/soffice` to point at a non-standard install.

## Maintainers

Bump `version` in `plugins/goonj-meetings-skill/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` on every change — that is what
pushes the update to everyone who has the plugin installed. Users pick it up with:

```bash
claude plugin update goonj-meetings-skill@goonj-skills
```

or, inside a session, `/plugin marketplace update goonj-skills` followed by
`/plugin install goonj-meetings-skill@goonj-skills`. Auto-update is off by default for
third-party marketplaces; a user can switch it on once under `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** →
**goonj-skills** → **Enable auto-update**.

Never commit a completed `meeting-report-glossary.md`, a transcript, or a generated report.
`.gitignore` blocks all three, but check before you push.
